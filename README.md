# TypeScript Runtime Error: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error that can occur in TypeScript even with type safety.  The example shows a `divide` function that throws an error if it attempts to divide by zero.

This highlights that while TypeScript helps prevent compile-time errors, it's essential to handle potential runtime errors like division by zero to create robust applications.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.ts` to see the code with the error.
3. Open `bugSolution.ts` to see the improved code with error handling.
4. Compile and run the TypeScript files using a compiler like `tsc`. 
5. Observe how the original code throws an error, while the improved version handles it gracefully.
